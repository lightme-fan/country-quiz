<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenShot.png)

You can see my demo by clicking this [link](https://lightme-fan-country-quiz.netlify.app/)


I had a lot struggles in this project.
  - I used custom hooks to fetch the data and all functionalities. But then I could hardly call the custom hooks in different components, especially with the Link and showing the score in the TryAgain page.

I learn new things from this project. 

### Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

- I have a component folder. In this folder, I have two folders which are Custom-hooks and Pages as well as App.js file
- In Custom hooks folder, there are two files, useFunctionalities.js and useFetch.
- The Pages folder contains 5 files: DisplayQuiz.js, HomePage.js, NextButton.js, Quiz-question.js and TryAgain.js.
- I also have few svg files.
- Lastly, I have index.css
